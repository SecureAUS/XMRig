Usage

The preferred way to configure the miner is the JSON config file as it is more flexible and human friendly. The command line interface does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.

Wizard helps you create initial configuration for the miner.
Workers helps manage your miners via HTTP API.

Donations

Default donation 1% (1 minute in 100 minutes) can be increased via option donate-level or disabled in source code.
